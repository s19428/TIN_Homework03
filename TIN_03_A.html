            Try to eat the sushi in one bite. Most sushi is small enough to fit into your mouth all at once. Eating all of the sushi in a single bite will allow you to enjoy all of the flavors of the rice, wrapper, and fish. If the sushi is too large to fit into your mouth, you can eat it in 2 bites, but you may want to let the chef know that you prefer smaller pieces.[8]
            Although some people argue that you must put the sushi fish-side down in your mouth, you can decide which way to eat the piece.
            Pay attention to how the flavors change as you eat the sushi. For example, you might notice a tender texture at first, followed by a slightly spicy finish.

            Eat bites of ginger in between different types of sushi to cleanse your palate. You probably ordered a few types of sushi, so you'll want to taste the difference between each of them. To refresh your mouth between different types of sushi, use your chopsticks to pick up a slice of ginger. Once you've eaten the ginger, you're ready to taste the next sushi.[9]
            Avoid draping the ginger on the sushi and eating them together.
            Ginger is sometimes pale white or bright pink if food coloring has been added.

            Try a variety of sushi to see what you like. If you're new to eating sushi, you might enjoy sushi rolls (maki) that include cooked fish, such as smoked salmon or tempura-fried seafood. To branch out, order a few pieces of nigiri or sashimi, including:[10]
            Sake (pronounced "sha-ke") - fresh salmon
            Maguro - bluefin tuna
            Hamachi - yellowtail tuna
            Ebi - cooked shrimp
            Unagi - freshwater eel
            Tai - red snapper
            Tako - octopus

            Communicate with the sushi chef. If you're sitting at the bar, let the chef know if you're enjoying the meal. For example, complement their rice since each sushi chef spends years creating their own rice recipe. You can also let the chef know if the pieces of sushi are too large or if you'd like to try a different style of sushi.[11]
            If you're not sitting at the bar but you want to let the chef know that you enjoyed your meal, see if the bar has a tip jar.

            Share different types of sushi with a friend. You can <div class="pulled-quotes"><p></p>enjoy a broader range of flavors</p></div> and textures if you order several rolls or pieces of nigiri and sashimi to share. Keep in mind that when you remove pieces of sushi from a communal plate, use the blunt end of the chopsticks. This way you won't spread germs.[12]
            It's perfectly fine to let your friend know if there are rolls or sashimi that you don't like. Just try to share the sushi that you both enjoy.

            Have fun and don't worry about making mistakes. You've probably heard some hard and fast rules about eating sushi, so it's understandable if you feel intimidated. Remember that you can eat sushi according to your personal preference. If you struggle to eat sashimi with chopsticks, it's fine to lift it up with a fork, for instance.
            Focus on enjoying your experience instead of following all the rules, especially if you're new to eating sushi.
